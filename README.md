# With all of the chaos around you, apprecieate your Mundane. 
We should never take a boring life for granted, as it is a privilege to have stability and predictability in our daily routines. 
We so easily become complacent and take the simple things in life for granted, such as having a place to sleep, the our enrollment in college, 
or even the ability to walk ourselves to class. While we may find these ideas "boring" or "tedious," to someone struggling with finacial 
hardship, death of a loved one, homelessness, or any of the many other chaos of the lives of others, these "boring" ideas are all they dream of. 
It is easy to forget, but important to remember, that our bad day may be someone else's everyday. 
# **Reflection On My Work**		
When I first approached this project, I originally had the idea to represent this idea by showing the same tree (no reason for the tree) in different panels undergoing 
individual hardships, like fire, flooding, etc, with one "boring" tree with nothing happening to it. I wanted the words underneath each panel to have a font that matches 
its respective condition to help reinforce the idea, however, as I continued this idea, I realized that each panel was going to be a project of its own and unfortunately 
I would not have the time to complete it. Below is how far I was able to take this project: 

![Scrapped Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122398220/221002260-99ebdcc4-a57a-431e-9178-4c7e10b2acd3.png)
Despite scrapping this project, I still liked the idea, so I began brainstorming how to convey it once again. I eventually settled on my final project, which shows a 
single, "boring" person surrounded by the chaos of the world. These chaos icons are haphazardly placed, embodying the chaos that the pictures themselves represent. Using 
the connotation that red-scale colors are "evil," I decided to make all of the chaos icons to be colorized using the red gradient, while the middle person is just plain, 
boring white. I also wanted to include text to better illustrate the idea. Below is what this produced.

This is also the version I submitted for peer review, which held some useful insight into what others were thinking. For example, user *arianakeith* suggested this idea:

While I like this idea, from the begining I imagined this image being seen as a sticker slapped on a bathroom stall or street sign; something you could see anywhere and 
understand at a glance. This is also why the image size is only 4" x 4". It was nice to see that user *Diego Jurado* shared this vision, saying <img width="509" alt="Feedback 2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122398220/221006825-7b4ef007-4c2d-4f45-bbba-9748ef70b6e1.png">

Because none of my peers indicated any revision *visually,* I took it into my own liberty to update the things I disliked about the project. First, I decided, with the 
suggestion from Ben, to copy all of the icons and paste them into the background, removing some of the distracting deadspace. While I like the effect it produced, it 
actually made it seem too chaotic and cluttered the icons so they were no longer discernible. Because of this, I decided to apply an increasing blur and desaturation 
to each proceding layer to add a sense of depth and make the icons more identifiable. In addition to this, I felt as if the words were flat and boring on the image, 
and they seemed rather novice compared to the rest of the project. To help this, I added highlights/shadows to the text to make it seem like the "sun" in the middle 
was illuminating them, as well as making them stand out. This produced my final submission that I am very happy with. <img width="1128" alt="Final Submission" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122398220/221008868-9095df52-ee29-404b-9830-4e05bb9608a7.png">

There are a couple things that I found very benifical when completeing the project. To start, keyboard commands really aided in speeding up my efficiency, especially 
with so many icons. The biggest ones I used was Shift + R (Rotate), Shift + S (Scale), and M (move). In addition to this, I kept my layers organized, even having 
subfolders in folders

These two things were by far the most helpful with getting this project done on time. 

Overall, I am happy with my project. I feel as if was able to successfully convey my idea in a easily digestable, small design. GIMP was a completely new program for me, so learning how to use all of the tools and effiecent organization was an enjoyable challange for me and I am glad I am at least comfortable with it.
