# **Why?**
 ##  With all of the chaos around you, apprecieate your Mundane. 
We should never take a boring life for granted, as it is a privilege to have stability and predictability in our daily routines. 
We so easily become complacent and take the simple things in life for granted, such as having a place to sleep, the our enrollment in college, 
or even the ability to walk ourselves to class. While we may find these ideas "boring" or "tedious," to someone struggling with finacial 
hardship, death of a loved one, homelessness, or any of the many other chaos of the lives of others, these "boring" ideas are all they dream of. 
It is easy to forget, but important to remember, that our bad day may be someone else's everyday. 
# **Reflection On My Work**		
When I first approached this project, I originally had the idea to represent this idea by showing the same tree (no reason for the tree) in different panels undergoing individual hardships, like fire, flooding, etc, with one "boring" tree with nothing happening to it. I wanted the words underneath each panel to have a font that matches its respective condition to help reinforce the idea, however, as I continued this idea, I realized that each panel was going to be a project of its own and unfortunately I would not have the time to complete it.
